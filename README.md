MindFlow is a mindfulness app that combines elements from various meditation and productivity apps. It aims to provide personalized and guided meditation sessions while incorporating task management and productivity tools. Users can customize meditation routines based on their preferences, integrating calming sounds, guided sessions, and breathing exercises. The app will also feature a task manager with a unique twist:
   - Encouraging users to set intentions before starting tasks
   - Progress tracking
   - Reminders for both meditation sessions and tasks
   - A community aspect for sharing experiences and tips on staying focused and mindful throughout the day.
